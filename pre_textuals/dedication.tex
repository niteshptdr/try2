   \textit{We all are the sum of many people - the result of their direct or indirect  efforts for us. We have no merit alone neither did nothing in our life by ourselves. Because this I dedicate this work to the wide web of people that somehow helped me to become what I am. When I remember the people around me in my life, with varying degrees of closeness, I realize that it is almost impossible to separate what is my own and what is influence absorbed from others. Because of this, I am continuously meditating about all my ancestors (also my parents in law) and my friends. It's always on my mind their disposition to help and their sacrifices to offer better life conditions to their sons, actions that paved the road I'm walking now. I'm grateful to all of you!}
