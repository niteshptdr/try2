   \textit{We all are the sum of many people - the result of their direct or indirect  efforts for us. We have no merit alone neither did nothing in our life by ourselves. Because this I dedicate this work to the wide web of people that somehow help me to become what I am. From the closest people to you, now and here, it's impossible to measure the complete impact of other people on us. But I am continuously meditating about all my ancestors (also my parents in law) and my friends. It's always on my mind their disposition to help and their sacrifices to offer better life conditions to their sons, actions that paved the road I'm walking now. I'm grateful to all of you!}
